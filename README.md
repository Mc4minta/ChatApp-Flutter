# Flutter chat app

A Flutter Chat app project guided by A Udemy course:
- [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2025 Edition] ](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)
- Section 14: Push Notifications & More: Building a Chat App with Flutter & Firebase

# Some notice
The Structure is base on the course but there are some features i added myself and some that I didn't follow the course.

## What I didn't follow
- I used Supabase storage instead of Firebase storage due to the fact that Firebase storage required credit card information to unlock storage features.
- In the same manner, i didn't implement the push notification functions completely, it can only receive message if I send message to the chat topic from Firebase messaging.
- Image upload progress
  
## What I add
- My own theme and app typo, generated by Gemini.
- Default user image if user didn't add image when signing up an account.
- Function to add image from gallery.
  
## What I might do in the future
- optimize and clearn the code
- fix some minor issues like image loading slowly in the char screen
- etc. depended on my time and mood (lol).
